60. Project - Phase 3 (Part b)
again change the form type to 
formtype encrypt - multiform formdata 


we should remove required tag from the form  for the image field 

in addnew list form we shoul dadd required field ..


In backend 
we should make changes to handle the new change 

as did in the new listing post middleware 
make change in the put middleware adding upload.single ("listing[image])

same changes in the controller section with extracting the  url and filepath from the req.file object . 
but in the updation wea re updating with  find and update query . 
in this query they are passing the req.body object . which doesnot contain the file object which is present in req.file 
if user doesnot provide image 
we should check the req.file object is defined or not . 
In JS to check wether the file is defined or not 
if(   typeOf  req.file  !== "undefined" )




preview section in edit page .. 

to develope a preview section in the edit form so that user will have an idea to change the image or not 

creating a small div and displaying there .

problem  high quality        that wuality is not required we should have general idea preview pixels 

tranformation of images  
cloudinary     pathparams after uploads/ e_blur 

before rendering the edit form   access the image url and using replacing methor 
replace("/upload,"/desided")




add this in resume ... tranformation qptimization

The Map -Getting Started with Maps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be relating to the location of the listing related to the single listing . 

we have so many options for maps API . 

here we will use google maps api  - 
other functionalities we can explore . 
we are not using it because google maps asks credit card .

MAPBOX

we will be using the public key that will be kept in the env file . we should not be keeping that in the public folder . 

This access token will be used for authentication by Map box .
Map box will accept only requests which contain the access  token


https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/


map box -  co ordinates first lattitude and then longitude .

generally first longitude and then lattitude


script file will be written in seperate public folder and there we cannot access the environmental variables of .env file 

so we need to access the environmental variable in the singlelisting and then access the variable directly in the map.js

we have created map.js for script but <script tag is not necessary 

I go an erro rbecause of the rendering of the map.js 
in boiler plate we have body of the single listing 
in single listing i should add the script inside the body tag becasue outsine the body tags will be excludede in the layOut .


till Now we stored the cordinates as the  constant , we need to vary the coordinates as per the listings location .

Geocoding is the process of converting the address in to the    geographic cordinates . 
which you can use to place markers or position  on the map . 

there can be many geocoding apis available 

when we are entering the address in the   aamzon or any website if they implement forward geocoding and backward geocoding .  

the address we are entering - convert into frward geocoding and they will be searcing the nearby cordinates and those coordinates will be backward geocoding and then will be appearing in the suggestions . 

https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/


import 
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js

forward and backward geocoding .
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/blob/main/docs/services.md


in controller section we are converting the address to  cordinates through geocoding . 

we are requirinbg th enpmmapbx client 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mapbox/mapbox-sdk

we are requiring the geoservices . 

in the create postaddnewListing controller service function 
when this is invoked with the client request . 
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/blob/main/docs/services.md#forwardgeocode
geocodingClient.forwardGeocode({
  query: 'Paris, France',
  limit: 2
})
  .send()
  .then(response => {
    const match = response.body;
  });


  since the function is async function with async keyword we are removing .then   

the configs in the forward limit is bydefault set to 5 . 
for suppose if user enters india there are many coordinates in the response , to limit them , we have set the limit to 5 byDefault .

response.body.features

features is the array   of the objects .
the number of objects in the array depends on the number of the value given to the limit .
to access the array with limit 1 [0]



we can store the cordinates in the db with listing model by creating another field called cordinates field name .
but we have a better option called geoJSON 



GeoJSON
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/

https://mongoosejs.com/docs/geojson.html

The data we are receiving from the mapBox is in geoJSON format 

lattitude and longitude general order 
but in mapBox its reverse 
Why geoJSON

mongodb database  inbuilt functionalities 

for example when we are in hyderabad and opening airbnb websiyte for near our surroundings we need to do some operations on the db to find the nearing listings . - db has some inbuilt functions .

After modifying the model according to thegeoJSON 

Time to create the dynamic map for each listing bcs at present it is static .

It can be done using marker .from mapBox

61. Project - Phase 3 (Part c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


we are  creating filters UI and restrunctiring minor things.
Then search UI 

1.filters div 

create a div  for all filters .
Then create a div for each filter 
then add icon in it and then text 

foe eah filter div 
 icon should be a div  and then text shouldbe para
   <!-- <div id="filter">
            <div>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i>

            </div>
            <div>
                Trending
            </div>
            
        </div> --> I have used  this 

        I have created two divs 
        instead one div and one p

 .filters{
        display : flex ;
        margin-top: 50px;
        margin-bottom: 100px ;
        justify-content: baseline ;
        align-items: center ;
        justify-content:space-evenly;
    }

    previously i have this styling to  bring each filter in same line and one after another  
    but we should keep flex wrap 


    text align center  for each filter stype property gave icons to move center not text why ?


    before hover - light dark   after dark - more  dark 
    
    After this    for functionality 

    modifying the modellisting 

    add a category field and in that type is string and a predifined  enum datatype  which consist of  all the elements in the filter .

    while  creating the listing we will provide user some dropdowns with the filters  options and then 


    ---switch  from   bootstrap 
    checkBox - > switch 

    form-check-reverse-class


    This  is for Display after taxes   in showing the price of the listing  - event listeners 

this can be achieved by event listeners - consider event .
  in script   we should access the document element using the id  
  Document.getElment ById

  click event  param   and a callback function .



  on opening console  or  any devide
  the filter icons will be  disrorted .

This can be avoided by adding mediaquery to the div or 
by adding a bootstrap class . 



Tax switch functionalities------------------------------------------------------------

To hide element   ---- 
  -   display hidden  -  doesnot takes div place
  -   visibility none    takes div place

here  i have named the element with id  .
as there are many group oof listigs    not  an single listing element so we are naming the element with class 

for loop   of each element 

element.style.display 

  if- != inline 

     inline 
  else 
     none



     Reverse was not working with reverse class untill we found out that bootstrap version is  changed 



-------------Search Option

inside a div and margin start as auto wit class .and navar class also 
margin start auto

search styling 
padding topright bottom left 


Backend feature 






==============================================================================
Hosting 
==============================================================================

first create a n account in mongo db 

Then create a cluster 

use the connection string in localenvirammnet . 

Before moving to finaldeployment state -  mongo session store 
express sessions .  by default session storage will be stored in local storage .

Compatable session stores.
mongo connect 

mongo session npm 

same like session but store is  mongodb 
session willhave multiple options . 

Touch after - Exlanation . = if user logged in to any website , if user closes the tab ,  and again if he opens the store then he no need to relogin if we have this option .
            - if there is no change in session  so no need toupdate the session right But when refresing the page updates the session again and again if user refreshes .
            session will be updated when we interact wit server side , 



========================
Deplyment with Render .

before deploying on render we will make change in the package json file . 

weshould pecify node version in the package.sjon file . 

node -v


Next is toconnect to gitHub account .

Proces of deployment ..localsystem - push to private git hub    render willaccess the information from gitHub 

New features will be pushed to gitHub and render willbe deployed in production .



========================================

Pushing Code to gitHub ..

1. Secretvalue for session  and  mongo db session . should be in .env 

we should not push .env file into the git hub .
and also node modules.

Git Init 
.DS_store   should not be pushed  which is created in Mac 

IGNORE  - > .gitIgnore 

Touch .gitignore // case sensitive .

we should specify the files and folders name in the gitignore .
.env  -filename 
node_modules/      -  folder name 

Mac dsstore .

if we want to be  ignoring any specific  which is existing anywhere from the project we shoul dadd the file name with a specialsyntax 

**/{filename}
