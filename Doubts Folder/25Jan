Filters Functionality .




So for the filters functionality to work we are modifying the listing model to have category  of type String .
Here why we are adding enum datatype of with some default filters ?

And we will provide dropDown to user while creating the listing right .

And for each filter should i add a get request to the  backend to (/filters) and then redirect to the listing page with specific category after querying and passing the listings data to home page  ?)

How to differentiate the filter that user clicked on filters icon  to  pass to the query with specific filter value  ?

is  only this way possible  of  get request and redirecting to listings page  or any other way ? 

what if we converts it into react they what is th solutio over there ?
